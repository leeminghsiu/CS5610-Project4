Very nice project idea, I kinda worked on a similar project for a hackathon to mint NFT so very cool to see other implementation

Here are my comments for the Final project code review
Good points
1. The code is well documented with comments so it is easy to understand and read
2. Props on implementing seperate connection for each db function as suggested by professor

Suggestion for improvement
1. The js and css files are not properly seperated so the code can be very structured
2. Alot of unused code that is commented out is still in the file
3. You could use proxy to avoid writing localhost:xxxx in fetch url
4. Avoid using cors

Here are my comments on the deployed website
Good points
1. Kudos on the changing the design on the website after the usability study
2. Very nice idea and definitely has potential for furthur scope
3. Instructions to use the site was displayed at the top, I think that is really helpful as minting NFT can be confusing to people
4. Adding a rubric page for the TAs and professor to grade was an amazing idea

Improvement points
1. In the communication, any user can update and delete comment of other users. Maybe it could be a future scope where you link users with the comments so they can update and delete only their comments
2. I personally feel that NFT or any blockchain technology is associated with high end graphics or dark theme(It is just a personal thought, a usability study you didn't ask for)
3. In the Rubric page, upon clicking each link and clicking okay in the alert id redirecting me to a non-exisiting page
4. The page could look beautiful with pagination
5. Also not sure if the site shows mint history of all the users

Overall, very nice project
